# Dataset Reader Development Repository for AllenNLP

Created from the [AllenNLP starting template repository](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-template-config-files), this repository is a simple place for me to work on implementations of Dataset Readers. The hope is that these readers will eventually make their way into the main [AllenNLP Repository](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp).

# Requirements:
* Python
* AllenNLP==1.5.0

## To-Do:

- **[SuperGLUE Tasks:](https://super.gluebenchmark.com/tasks)**
  - [ReCoRD](https://sheng-z.github.io/ReCoRD-explorer/) ([Issue](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/issues/4995))
- **[CodeXGLUE Tasks:](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE)**
  - [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet)
- [Conala](https://conala-corpus.github.io/)
- Juice
