It was not immediately clear exactly how the alert was linked to the terror group. Threats were made against the central Hauptbahnhof station and the Pasing station west of the city, Police Chief Hubertus Andrae said. The stations  were evacuated on Thursday evening and service stopped for around eight hours. Authorities told the public additional officers were being called in to find possible suspects. On Friday, 100 additional officers were still on duty, Andrae said.\n@highlight\nThe plot involved five to seven potential suicide attackers\n@highlight\nThe tip about the plot came from another country's intelligence agency\n@highlight\nPolice asked residents to avoid large public crowds",
